Jigsawx
=======

Jigsaw game framework written in Haxe for cross platform use.
( Java, Flash, JS, C++ )

The Haxe 2 version can be found on googlecode and supports js, flash, NME ( c++ ) target examples.
http://code.google.com/p/jigsawx/

The github version here has been updated to Haxe 3 but currently only has Java ( awt/swing ) target example use.
The Java example is probably not as good as other target examples.

It has been setup to allow applets but permissions are currently an issue that evade me so currently only desktop
in the Java target example. 

Jigsaw game drawing code has been improved on haxe2 version but not yet updated on either version.
